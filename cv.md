### Summary

I classify myself as a lifelong learner. After more than 10 years of private activityin the field of fashion, I acquired the specialty of Web Developer at VTMC and in arelatively short time listened to a lot of different IT learning on online learning platforms (Coursera, Udemy, LinkedIn, freeCodeCamp). I have the patience and perseverance to do tasks or work. I was convinced of that by working on myown. I can plan my working time and I am guided by the principle - not to try, but todo, not to doubt, but to believe, not to besurprised, but to act. I am currently looking for an IT company with the need for a new team member (Junior Front-End Developer or Junior Full-Stack Software Developer). In addition to the desire to learn from the best, I will also bring my attitude and perseverance to complete what has been started, along with my creativity, the attention to detail will be a major contribution to my next company where I will work.
